${project.name}

  Abstract classes to manage report generation, which can be run both:
  
  * as part of a site generation, as a {{{../maven-reporting-api/}maven-reporting-api}}'s
  <<<{{{../maven-reporting-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/MavenReport.html}MavenReport}}>>>,

  * or as a direct standalone goal invocation, as a {{{/ref/current/maven-plugin-api/}maven-plugin-api}}'s
  <<<{{{/ref/current/maven-plugin-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/Mojo.html}Mojo}}>>>.

  []

* Usage

  A full working sample is included in <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> ITs, which are part of 
  {{{../source-repository.html}the component source tree}}: see <<<src/it/setup-reporting-plugin>>>.

* History

** Inclusion in Maven core

  Until Maven 2.0.4, <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> was included in Maven 2 core distribution: version
  used was completely driven by Maven version used.
  
  The module was removed from Maven core starting with Maven 2.0.5 and
  moved to shared components to improve fexibility: starting with Maven 2.0.5, each plugin can choose its
  <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> version independently from Maven.

** Doxia runtime

  When used as a direct standalone goal invocation, Doxia implementation used is the version used during plugin compilation.

  When used as report during site generation, <<<maven-site-plugin>>> provides Doxia API implementation to the plugin, overriding
  normal plugin dependency: see
  {{{/shared/maven-reporting-exec/xref/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/DefaultMavenReportExecutor.html}DefaultMavenReportExecutor}}
  in <<<{{{/shared/maven-reporting-exec/}maven-reporting-exec}}>>>.

** Doxia dependency

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.0.x>>> use Doxia 1.0, then is used for reporting plugins wanting Maven 2.0.x compatibility.

  From <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.1>>> to <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.3>>>, Doxia version used ranges from 1.1 to 1.4.
  When creating a reporting plugin using one of these <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> versions,
  take care to use corresponding <<<doxia-sink-api>>>:

  * avoid <<<doxia-sink-api>>> version 1.0 that can be imported by <<<{{{../maven-reporting-api/}maven-reporting-api}}>>> 3.0:
  this would lead to <<<"java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.SinkEventAttributes">>> when used as
  direct standalone goal.

  * avoid <<<doxia-sink-api>>> after 1.4 since RenderingContext was moved in Doxia 1.5 from core to Site Renderer (see
  {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DOXIA-499}DOXIA-499}}).

  []

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.4.x>>> use Doxia 1.6.

** Upgrading to <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.3+>>>

  When upgrading a reporting plugin from an old version of <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> to version 2.3 or more,
  a lot of copy/pasted code can be removed by upgrading the plugin to
  {{{/plugin-tools/maven-plugin-tools-annotations/}plugin-tools with Java 5 annotations}}:
  see {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHARED-347}MSHARED-347}} for more details.
