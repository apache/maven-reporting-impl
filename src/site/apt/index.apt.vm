${project.name}

  Abstract classes to manage report generation, which can be run both:
  
  1. as part of a <<site generation>>, as a {{{../maven-reporting-api/}maven-reporting-api}}'s
  <<<{{{../maven-reporting-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/MavenReport.html}MavenReport}}>>>,

  2. or as a direct standalone <<goal invocation>>, as a {{{/ref/current/maven-plugin-api/}maven-plugin-api}}'s
  <<<{{{/ref/current/maven-plugin-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/Mojo.html}Mojo}}>>>.

  []

  The two APIs implementations are provided by <<<{{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/AbstractMavenReport.html}AbstractMavenReport}}>>>,
  that delegates to extender's <<<executeReport( Locale )>>> reporting method implementation.

  Notice that Doxia version used at runtime varies between <<site generation>> and <<goal invocation>>:

  1. when used as report during <<site generation>>, <<<maven-site-plugin>>> provides Doxia implementation to the plugin, overriding
  normal plugin dependency: see
  {{{/shared/maven-reporting-exec/xref/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/DefaultMavenReportExecutor.html}DefaultMavenReportExecutor}}
  in <<<{{{/shared/maven-reporting-exec/}maven-reporting-exec}}>>>.

  2. when used as a direct standalone <<goal invocation>>, Doxia implementation used is the version used during plugin compilation
  and kept as transitive dependency of the plugin.

* Usage

  A full working sample is included in <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> ITs, which are part of 
  {{{../scm.html}the component source tree}}: see {{{https://github.com/apache/maven-reporting-impl/tree/${project.scm.tag}/src/it/setup-reporting-plugin}<<<src/it/setup-reporting-plugin>>>}}.

** Upgrading to <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.3+>>>

  When upgrading a reporting plugin from an old version of <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> to version 2.3 or more,
  a lot of copy/pasted code can be removed by upgrading the plugin to
  {{{/plugin-tools/maven-plugin-tools-annotations/}plugin-tools with Java 5 annotations}}:
  see {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHARED-347}MSHARED-347}} for more details.
