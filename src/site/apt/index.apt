Maven Reporting Implementation

  Abstract classes to manage report generation.

  Until Maven 2.0.4, <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> was included in Maven 2 core distribution: version
  used was completely driven by Maven version used. It was removed from Maven core starting with Maven 2.0.5 and
  moved to shared components to improve fexibility: starting with Maven 2.0.5, each plugin can choose its
  <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> version independently from Maven.

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.0.x>>> uses Doxia 1.0, then is used for plugins wanting Maven 2.0.x compatibility.

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.1.x>>> uses Doxia 1.1: using this version implies for a plugin that it has Maven 2.1
  as prerequisite.
