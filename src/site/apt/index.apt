Maven Reporting Implementation

  Abstract classes to manage report generation, which can be run both:
  
  * as part of a site generation (as a {{{../maven-reporting-api/}maven-reporting-api}}'s
  <<<{{{../maven-reporting-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/MavenReport.html}MavenReport}}>>>),

  * or as a direct standalone invocation (as a {{{/ref/current/maven-plugin-api/}maven-plugin-api}}'s
  <<<{{{/ref/current/maven-plugin-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/Mojo.html}Mojo}})>>>.

  []

* Usage

  Creating a new report plugin can be done by copying
  <<<{{{./xref-test/org/apache/maven/reporting/AbstractMavenReportTest.html}AbstractMavenReportTest.java}}>>>
  structure and implement a few methods.

* History

** inclusion in Maven core

  Until Maven 2.0.4, <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> was included in Maven 2 core distribution: version
  used was completely driven by Maven version used.
  
  The module was removed from Maven core starting with Maven 2.0.5 and
  moved to shared components to improve fexibility: starting with Maven 2.0.5, each plugin can choose its
  <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> version independently from Maven.

** Doxia dependency

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.0.x>>> use Doxia 1.0, then is used for reporting plugins wanting Maven 2.0.x compatibility.

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.1.x>>> use Doxia 1.1: using this version implies for a reporting plugin that it has Maven 2.1
  as prerequisite.

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.2.x>>> use Doxia 1.2.
